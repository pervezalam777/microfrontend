## Naming convention
Having a file naming convention in your application makes in more maintainable. As there are various types of naming convention available (e.g. kebab-case, snake_case, lowerCamelCase, UpperCamelCase). in this repo i have chosen lowerCamelCase. (Observation: I have seen some issues with other casing with sonar specially for code files.) 
- `Icon` icon name should start with 'ic' (e.g. icSearch.svg). 
- `image` image name should start with 'img' (e.g. imgAvatar.jpg).
