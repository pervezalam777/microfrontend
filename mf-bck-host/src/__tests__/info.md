# Unit Test Cases
Believe me or not writing a test case before writing the actual code helps to make you a better programmer.

## `TDD`
`Test driven development` While writing function as small unit we always know what we are going to give as input to that function and what we would get as output but what we usually lack it that if we know input and output of a function before actually writing a implementation then why not writing it as test first. After that write the logic and test that with your expectation.

### `Do not fake it`
Unit test case can be faked if assertion of test case not implemented properly. Such type of code are prone to introduce bugs in the application and unit test case itself. 

### `Roadblock for TDD` 
When you senior pushes you to complete the functionality ASAP so that it can be showcase to the client and he/she consider unit test as second priority or less important. Or sometime you don't understand the significance of TDD

### `Approach`
While following the approach of test driven development IDE should have three parallel panel first one should have test file open, second panel should have code file and in third panel run the unit test case in watch mode.
